## Why MergeSVG?
After adding SVG badges and illustrations to my GitHub README, I often saw empty gaps when remote assets failed to load. Moreover, README’s limited Markdown makes it hard to get banner layouts to look exactly the way I want. So I built MergeSVG: a browser-based, drag-and-drop tool that merges SVGs into a single, self-contained file and lets you position, resize and style graphics visually. In conclusion, your README will always appear exactly as you designed it.


## Features
- **Flexible uploads** — Add SVGs via Data URIs, URLs, or raw .svg files (drag & drop or file picker).
- **Design freedom without Markdown limitations** — No markdown or HTML syntax required; design intuitively with drag & drop.
- **Customizable canvas background** — Control background color, transparency, and patterns (grid, dots, checkerboard).
- **Real-time preview** — See your composition as you build it.
- **One-click export** — Download your merged SVG instantly.
- **Client-side processing** — Fast, secure, and private—everything runs in your browser.
- **No more broken links** — The app embeds raw SVG content into a single file so external resources can’t break your layout.
